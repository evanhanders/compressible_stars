\section{Transfer function: linear theory describes surface manifestation}
\label{sec:transfer_verification}

This is the section where we open Garage Band and put our bar filter on the recordings we took earlier.
We see if the filter actually reproduces the resonances of the bar, etc.

Need to check through the transfer function derivation and theory here carefully. 
It may be useful to include Kyle here?
