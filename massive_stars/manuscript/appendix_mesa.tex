\section{MESA} 
\label{app:mesa}

The MESA EOS is a blend of the OPAL \citep{Rogers2002}, SCVH
\citep{Saumon1995}, FreeEOS \citep{Irwin2004}, HELM \citep{Timmes2000},
and PC \citep{Potekhin2010} EOSes.

Radiative opacities are primarily from OPAL \citep{Iglesias1993,
Iglesias1996}, with low-temperature data from \citet{Ferguson2005}
and the high-temperature, Compton-scattering dominated regime by
\citet{Buchler1976}.  Electron conduction opacities are from
\citet{Cassisi2007}.

Nuclear reaction rates are from JINA REACLIB \citep{Cyburt2010} plus
additional tabulated weak reaction rates \citet{Fuller1985, Oda1994,
Langanke2000}.
Screening is included via the prescription of \citet{Chugunov2007}.
Thermal neutrino loss rates are from \citet{Itoh1996}.
