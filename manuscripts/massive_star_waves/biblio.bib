 abstract = {Implicit-explicit (IMEX) linear multistep methods are popular techniques for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) with terms of different types. While fixed timestep versions of such schemes have been developed and studied, implicit-explicit schemes also naturally arise in general situations where the temporal smoothness of the solution changes. In this paper we consider easily implementable variable step-size implicit-explicit (VSIMEX) linear multistep methods for time-dependent PDEs. Families of order-p, p step VSIMEX schemes are constructed and analyzed, where p ranges from 1 to 4. The corresponding schemes are simple to implement and have the property that they reduce to the classical IMEX schemes whenever constant time step-sizes are imposed. The methods are validated on the Burgers' equation. These results demonstrate that by varying the time step-size, VSIMEX methods can outperform their fixed time step counterparts while still maintaining good numerical behavior.},

    TITLE = {A Reduced Model for Salt-Finger Convection in the Small Diffusivity Ratio Limit},

    ABSTRACT = {A simple model of nonlinear salt-ﬁnger convection in two dimensions is derived and studied. The model is valid in the limit of a small solute to heat diffusivity ratio and a large density ratio, which is relevant to both oceanographic and astrophysical applications. Two limits distinguished by the magnitude of the Schmidt number are found. For order one Schmidt numbers, appropriate for astrophysical applications, a modiﬁed Rayleigh–Bénard system with large-scale damping due to a stabilizing temperature is obtained. For large Schmidt numbers, appropriate for the oceanic setting, the model combines a prognostic equation for the solute ﬁeld and a diagnostic equation for inertia-free momentum dynamics. Two distinct saturation regimes are identiﬁed for the second model: the weakly driven regime is characterized by a large-scale ﬂow associated with a balance between advection and linear instability, while the strongly-driven regime produces multiscale structures, resulting in a balance between energy input through linear instability and energy transfer between scales. For both regimes, we analytically predict and numerically conﬁrm the dependence of the kinetic energy and salinity ﬂuxes on the ratio between solutal and thermal Rayleigh numbers. The spectra and probability density functions are also computed.},

For that purpose, we have run a series of 3D direct numerical simulations solving the Navier–Stokes equations under the Boussinesq approximation in a spherical shell geometry. We observe that the overshooting of the turbulent motions into the stably stratified region depends on three different parameters: the relative stability of the RZ, the transition width between the two, and the intensity of the turbulence. In the cases studied, these motions manage to partially alter the thermal stratification and induce thermal mixing, but not so efficiently as to extend the nominal CZ further down into the stable region. We find that the kinetic energy below the convection zone can be modelled by a half-Gaussian profile whose amplitude and width can be predicted a priori for all of our simulations. We examine different dynamical length-scales related to the depth of the extension of the motions into the RZ, and we find that they all scale remarkably well with a length-scale that stems from a simple energetic argument. We discuss the implications of our findings for 1D stellar evolution calculations.}",

In particular, we discuss the initial conditions for Population III star formation, as given by variants of the cold dark matter cosmology. Numerical simulations have investigated the collapse and the fragmentation of metal-free gas, showing that the first stars were predominantly very massive. The exact determination of the stellar masses, and the precise form of the primordial initial mass function, is still hampered by our limited understanding of the accretion physics and the protostellar feedback effects. We address the importance of heavy elements in bringing about the transition from an early star formation mode dominated by massive stars to the familiar mode dominated by low-mass stars at later times. We show how complementary observations, both at high redshifts and in our local cosmic neighborhood, can be utilized to probe the first epoch of star formation. }
