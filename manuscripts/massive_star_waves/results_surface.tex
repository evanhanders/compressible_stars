\section{Surface manifestation of gravity waves}
\label{sec:results_surface}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Show or refer to a picture of a simulation dominated by standing waves.
\item Show the power spectrum at a few ells, and then the ``observational'' spectrum over one hemisphere summed over all the ells.
\item Show that the transfer function (refer to an appendix? derive?) does a good job of describing waves at different frequencies.
\item Mention the places where transfer function doesn't do great: high frequency peaks and troughs (due to timestepping? cite appendix) and the damping side of things (TODO fix this do it better.)
\item Show that the summed transfer function does a good job of describing the summed luminosity.
\item Mention that, surprisingly, we really don't have to run the simulations that long...
\item Talk about the quality factor of the peaks.
\end{enumerate}
