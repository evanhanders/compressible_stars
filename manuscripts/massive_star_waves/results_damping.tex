\section{Results of simulations with damping layers}
\label{sec:results_damping}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Show or refer to a picture of a simulation where the waves are obviously damped in the outer layer.
\item Discuss that these simulations are in the traveling wave regime so we can get properties of the waves as they are generated and propagate outwards with little reflection.
\item Show that the wave luminosity is constant with radius in the star, and demonstrate that this is expected from the linear eigenfunctions.
\item Show that the wave luminosity is fairly constant with increasing Reynolds number, so our answer is a good approximation for actual stars.
\item Show that the wave luminosity can be well-described by a power law. Report that power law in dimensional units. Compare to literature values.
\end{enumerate}
