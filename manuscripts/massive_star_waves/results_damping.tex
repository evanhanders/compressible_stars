\section{Results of simulations with damping layers}
\label{sec:results_damping}

This is the ``recording studio'' section -- it's useful to report the amplitude here because the theory doesn't give that.

We should run simulations as turbulent as possible here.
Hopefully more turbulnce doesn't change the result.
We will ignore the low-resolution laminar runs.

We report that we see powerlaw wave fluxes at all turbulence values, and no scaling with turbulence (hopefully).
