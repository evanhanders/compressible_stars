\section{Transfer function extrapolation to real stars}
\label{sec:transfer_extrapolation}

This is where we say, based on the last section, the bar filter does a pretty good job of turning studio into bar.
So, let's now see what happens if we use a stadium filter instead of a bar filter (whole star instead of sim).
We obviously can't actually simulate a whole star, but our hope is that this gives us an idea of what gravity waves would look like on stars in gyre.

TODO find an actual star to compare to by including Matteo.
